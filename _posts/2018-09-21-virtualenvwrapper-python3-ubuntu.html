					<p>Virtual Environment Wrapper, most commonly known as

						virtualenvwrapper,</a>is a nifty tool that you, as a Python developer,

				<b>The Why:</b>
			</div>
				<div class="section-desc">
					<p>While trying to install virtualenvwrapper on my new Kubuntu 
						18.04LTS distro, I noticed that following the usual 
						instructions on virtualenvwrapper's <a class="page-link" href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">Read the Docs page</a>doesn't exactly prove to be useful in installing 
						virtualenvwrapper. It took me an hour to figure out how to 
						install virtualenvwrapper so that it's full functional. Thus
						this small article was born.

				<b>The How:</b>
			</div>
				<div class="section-desc">
					Without further ado, let's jump into how I installed 
					virtualenvwrapper on my Kubuntu system running Python 3. 
					<b>Note:</b> The instructions here are for Python 3, but 
					they may work for Python 2 environments as well. 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Step 1:</b> Check and install pip3. To check if you have
							pip3 installed, open up a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T should
							do the trick) and type <br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppip3 --version</code><br/>
							You should see something similar to this:<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.6)</code><br/>
							If pip3 is not install, you can easily install it by 
							entering<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsudo apt-get install python3-pip</code><br/>
							on your terminal.<p/>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Step 2:</b> Install virtualenvwrapper:<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper</code><br/>
							<b>Note:</b> Usually you wouldn't install pip packages globally,
							but it's much easier if you install virtualenvwrapper globally
							due to its dependencies being set up a certain way that makes
							global installation easier.<p/>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Step 3:</b> Add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspexport WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs</code><br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspexport PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel</code><br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh</code><br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3</code><br/>
							Once you do that, you should be all set to proceed to the next step.
						</li><p/>
						<li>
							<b>Step 4:</b> Now it's the moment of truth. type<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsource ~/.bashrc</code><br/>
							to finish the setup. If all goes well, you should not see any 
							errors. After you're done, enter<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspworkon</code><br/>
							If you don't see anything, that means your command works 
							but you don't have a virtualenv yet. So let's go ahead and make one.
						</li><p/>
						<li>
							<b>Step 5:</b> Make a test virtual environment<br/>
								<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmkvirtualenv test</code><br/>
							The output should be similar to this:<br/>
							<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing base prefix '/usr'</code><br/>
							<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNew python executable in /home/aishtiaque/.virtualenvs/test/bin/python3</code><br/>
							<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlso creating executable in /home/aishtiaque/.virtualenvs/test/bin/python</code><br/>
							<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInstalling setuptools, pip, wheel...done.</code><br/>
							<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(test) user@computer:~$</code><br/>
							And you are in the new virtualenv! Check to see if pip 
							has the right packages:<br/>
							<code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppip freeze</code><br/>
							shouldn't give you any output.
						</li><p/>
					</ul>
					Voila! You should be all set now. You can head over to 
					virtualenvwrapper's documentation for details on its commands.
